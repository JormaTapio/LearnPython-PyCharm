Hello you too

I have created this repo while I was practising my PyCharm skills better by watching amico Nelson's wonderful Youtube courses:
https://youtu.be/hc50ALh_x5g "PyCharm Tutorial | Full Course in 2 Hours" and 
https://youtu.be/LzYNWme1W6Q "Python Full Course üêç". I have made a couple of marks to me. And as you know the learning is about ten times 
more memorable when you write something down than just watching and listening.

I appreciate you efforts Amigoscode.
